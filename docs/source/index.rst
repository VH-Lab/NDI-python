NDI System - Python
*******************

Welcome to the ndi-python docs! 
This library aims to be a template for future NDI System implementations. Utilizing the flatbuffer intermediaries defined in `ndi-schema <https://sqm.io>`_, it provides interfaces with the MFDAQ System, a file system database implementation, and a generalized SQL implementation using Python.

The information here assumes some familiarity with Python and basic software design. It contains technical information on the :code:`ndi` API, including key features, basic operation, and employed technologies.
