  database
    A repository of data structured by :term:`collection`. In this library, a database could refer to any store of information that follows the schema defined in `ndi-schema <>`_. It could be implemented as a posgres or mongo database, a file system, a cache, or any other form of stored data.

  collection
    A subset of structured data in a :term:`database` that takes its structure from a flatbuffer table in `ndi-schema <>`_. In a NoSQL database this would fall under the same name, but in a SQL database this might be refered to as a table.
