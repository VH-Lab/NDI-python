  DAQ
    An abbreviation for "Data AQuisition". A DAQ system consists of a sensor that picks up some analog signal, a DAQ device that converts that output to digital, and software that can process, store, and make use of the resulting data.

  NDI schema
    A :term:`flatbuffer` table that is used to generate a :term:`flatbuffer class`.

  flatbuffer class
    These are generated by the flatbuffer schema compiler `flatc <https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_using_schema_compiler.html>`_ when run with the :code:`--python` flag. The :term:`NDI schema` that build our flatbuffer classes can be found at `ndi_schema <>`_.

  .. currentmodule:: ndi.ndi_object
  NDI class
    A class derived from :class:`NDI_Object`, whose purpose is to act as a wrapper for a :term:`flatbuffer class`. It serves as simplified means of quickly converting between an :term:`NDI object` and and its :term:`flatbuffer` bytearrays.

  NDI object
    An instance of an :term:`NDI class`.

  flatbuffer
    A cross-platform data serialization format. Flatbuffers are highly efficient at accessing large amounts of serialized data at minimal memory and processing cost. It achieves this by relying upon predefined schema that are known to all parties involved. See the docs `here <https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/>`_

  database
    A repository of data structured by :term:`collection`. In this library, a database could refer to any store of information that follows the schema defined in `ndi-schema <>`_. It could be implemented as a posgres or mongo database, a file system, a cache, or any other form of stored data.
    .. note::
      The current library implements SQL and FileSystem databases.

  collection
    A subset of structured data in a :term:`database` that takes its structure from a flatbuffer table in `ndi-schema <>`_. In a NoSQL database this would fall under the same name, but in a SQL database this might be refered to as a table.

  field
    TODO: finish

  document
    TODO: finish

  NDI query
    An instance of :class:`Query`, :class:`AndQuery`, or :class:`OrQuery`. Contains a query or list of queries, where a single query has properties *field*, *operator*, and *value*. Used for ``find``, ``update_many``, and ``delete_many`` database methods.

  payload
    A dict whose keys are a subset of the fields in a given :term:`collection`, and whose values must comply with the types defined for those fields in the corresponding table defined by the `ndi-schema <>`_. For example, the following :term:`NDI schema`:
    ::
      enum ProbeType:ubyte {
        ntrode,
        electrode,
        patch,

      }
      table Probe {
        id:string;
        name:string;
        reference:ushort;
        type:ProbeType;
        daq_system_id:string;
      }
    might have payloads that look like any of the following:
    ::
      p1 = {
        'id': '123j4h1h4g5hg35c7h',
        'name': 'probe_1',
        'reference': 1,
        'type': 'electrode',
        'daq_system_id': '8907b785nm5d4d5hmd',
      }
      p1_update = {
        'id': '123j4h1h4g5hg35c7h',
        'name': 'probe_1',
        'type': 'patch',
      }
      p_empty = {}

  CRUD
    A term for the collection of :term:`database` operations that Create, Read, Update, or Delete a :term:`document`.

  SQLA document
    A SQL Alchemy representation of a table row.

  SQLA table
    A SQL Alchemy representation of a table (`docs <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/metadata.html>`_\ ).
